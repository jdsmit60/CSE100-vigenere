# CSE100-vigenere
Honors contract for my CSE 100 class in the Spring of 2017.

Written in C++ to fulfill the [specification given by Harvard University for their cs50 class](http://docs.cs50.net/problems/vigenere/vigenere.html).

If this project is improved in the future, I would like to hide both the keyword and the plaintext when they are entered. I may also implement a deciphering program.
